# Vending Machine
A class-based Vending Machine written in JavaScript, using Jest for testing.

## SetUp
1. Install dev dependencies 
`npm install`
2. Install Jest
`npm install --save-dev jest`

## What I Learned / Proud of
1. Review Object-Oriented programming in JS
2. By using objects instead of arrays inside class decleration, it reduces the complexity of methods inside (performance FTW!)
3. Reinforce knowledge of Jest as testing tool
